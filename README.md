# Project 6: Buck Converters
# Varying Fidelity Levels to Step-Down Alternating Current from Solar Chargers

● Introduced Pulse-Width Modulation to obtain a reduced average output voltage from an open-circuit voltage of 15V                 
● Smoothed high-frequency pulses with a Zener diode and a low-pass filter for a 25% duty cycle, modelled in MATLAB               
● Incorporated a high-fidelity, non-linear representation to allow for charging of the mobile device with a 5V capacity
